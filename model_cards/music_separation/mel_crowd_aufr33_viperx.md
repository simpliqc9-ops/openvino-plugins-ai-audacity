# MelBandRoformer Crowd Extraction / Removal (@aufr33 & @viperx)

A MelBandRoformer-based crowd extraction / removal model that excels at extracting crowd noise from live recordings. As this is a MelBandRoformer model, it's quite a heavy model so expect long processing times.

Note that this model natively produces a single 'crowd' stem. The 'no crowd' is produced by subtracting the 'crowd' stem from the input track:
```
no_crowd = input_track - crowd
```

This model was trained by [@aufr33](https://github.com/aufr33) & [@viperx](https://github.com/playdasegunda)
