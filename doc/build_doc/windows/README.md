# Audacity OpenVINO module build for Windows :hammer:

The recommended method to build these plugins for Windows is to use the `fetch_build_package.bat` script located here: [Windows Build Tools](../../../tools/windows)

You'll find a README there that describes the setup needed, and instructions for running the build / packaging script(s).

# Need Help? :raising_hand_man:
